filter_rules
============

These are base classes for a possible implementation of the specification pattern (or an specification language) in Python, proving a rather DSL-ish interface. The idea is to build a rather declarative language to express conditions for a policy from basic blocks, and have the policy tested against an instance of an object. The concept can be found under different names in the literature; for instance, in Eric Evan's Domain Driven Design.
